# 🎬 Blockbusters, Bombs & Hidden Gems: What SQL Taught Me About the Movie Industry

## 📁 Project: Analyzing Movie Data Using SQL (with some unexpected discoveries!)

This project dives into a real-world movie dataset to clean, explore, and derive insights using **pure MySQL** — and it was anything but ordinary.

### 🔧 Step 1: Data Cleaning

- ✅ Checked and removed duplicates  
- 🔄 Standardized data types (e.g., converting dates & nulls)  
- ✂️ Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., homepage, tagline)  
- 📌 Replaced missing values with 'Unknown' where relevant

### 📊 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using SQL, I uncovered:

- 🎥 **Average budget** = $29M, while **average revenue** = $82M  
- 🧨 Outliers like “The Wolfman” — lost $150M even with a $100M+ budget  

#### 📈 Strong Correlations:
- Budget & Revenue → `r = 0.73`  
- Budget & Popularity → `r = 0.50`  

#### 🍿 Top Profitable Films:
- Avatar, Titanic, Furious 7

#### 🎭 Top Genres by Count:
- Drama, Comedy

#### 💸 Top Genres by Avg. Revenue:
- Family Fantasy Adventure, Crime Thriller

#### 🗓️ Most Movie Releases:
- 2009, 2014, 2006

#### 👑 Hidden Gems:
- Popular movies like *Shawshank Redemption* with surprisingly low revenue
