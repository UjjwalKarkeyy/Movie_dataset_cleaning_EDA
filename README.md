This week, I dove into a real-world movie dataset to clean, explore, and derive insights using pure MySQL — and it was anything but ordinary!


🔧 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 1: 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠
✅ Checked and removed duplicates
🔄 Standardized data types (e.g., converting dates & nulls)
✂️ Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., homepage, tagline)
📌 Replaced missing values with 'Unknown' where relevant


📊 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 2: 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 (𝐄𝐃𝐀)
 Using SQL, I uncovered:
🎥 Average budget = $29M, while average revenue = $82M!
🧨 Outliers like “The Wolfman” — lost $150M even with a $100M+ budget

📈 𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴:
Budget & Revenue (r = 0.73)
Budget & Popularity (r = 0.50)

🍿 Top Profitable Films: Avatar, Titanic, Furious 7
🎭 Top Genres by Count: Drama, Comedy
💸 Top Genres by Avg. Revenue: Family Fantasy Adventure, Crime Thriller
🗓️ Most Movie Releases: 2009, 2014, 2006
👑 Hidden Gems: Popular movies like Shawshank Redemption with surprisingly low revenue


🧠 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:
SQL alone can drive deep insights.
Simple queries, when stacked with logic, can tell powerful stories.
Cleaning > Analysis — unless your data is reliable, insights are just noise.
